# Online Grievance Redressal System
Introduction
The Online Grievance Redressal System is an online platform designed to facilitate the reception and redressal of grievances by stakeholders of an institution. This system aims to address issues raised by students promptly, enabling better services and capturing the true state of student satisfaction.

Unlike conventional grievance redressal methods where complaints are addressed through letters or applications, this online platform is more robust and efficient. Students can easily log in, submit their complaints, and provide evidence if necessary. The grievance administrator then analyzes the complaint and forwards it to the concerned grievance cell member, who deals with the issue promptly and takes appropriate action.
